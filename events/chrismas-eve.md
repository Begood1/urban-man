Half of UK motorists will cram onto main roads and motorways today, as Christmas Eve travellers have been warned they face gridlock.

Research by the AA has found that the rush of last-minute present-buyers and people setting off to visit family is likely to cause jams on arterial routes across the country.

Commuter traffic will be reduced as many people booked the day off work for an extended Christmas break.

But this will be partly offset by increased leisure journeys, with more than one in five (23 percent) visiting family and friends and a further 16 percent making a shopping or other day trip.

Analysis by the RAC and traffic information supplier Inrix predicted that roads will be busiest between 11am and 1pm.

The worst road for long delays is expected to be the M1 northbound from Junction 21 (Coventry/Leicester) to Junction 26 (Nottingham/Ripley).

The M25, M5, M6 and M40 have also been identified as "likely to see significant delays" over the festive period.

Highways England lifted more than 200 miles of roadworks on the country's motorways and major A-roads on Friday to ensure more than 97% of its network is open.
