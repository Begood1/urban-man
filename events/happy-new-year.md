A gathering of Christian families at church on New Years Eve is an exciting and wonderful way to have a lot of fun together, reflect on the previous year and anticipate the New Year! These New Years Events as a church family can bring you closer to God and closer to family and friends. What better place to spend the New Years than at church.
